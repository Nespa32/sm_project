'cap_wordcloud' - an unoriginal attempt to combine 'sound capture' and 'wordclouds'

What you'll need:
- FLAC (https://xiph.org/flac/download.html)
- Nasm (because of FLAC - http://www.nasm.us/)
- Ogg (because of FLAC - https://xiph.org/downloads/)
- A lot of patience (no link for this)

How to setup:

After you've got FLAC somewhere on the system, copy libFLAC_dynamic.lib and libFLAC++_dynamic.lib
to include\lib\ (lib\ might not exist yet, create it)
Open the cap_wordcloud.sln, then Build|Build Solution, hope for the best
After that's (hopefully) done, the executable in Debug/ (or Release/) can't run yet. Add libFLAC_dynamic.dll
and libFLAC++_dynamic.dll to the folder.
